# Gender_Detection_System
This project is a computer visionâ€“based Gender Detection System built using deep learning. The system can predict a person's gender based on facial features extracted from an image. It combines a powerful pipeline that includes YOLO for face detection and ResNet50 as a pre-trained feature extractor for accurate classification.
